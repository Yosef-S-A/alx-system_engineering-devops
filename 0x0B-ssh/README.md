# SSH

In this project, I became familiar connecting to and working with servers using the SSH protocol. I worked on a server provided by ALX-Holberton School.

## Tasks :clipboard:

:zero: **Use a private key**
       - Bash script that uses `ssh` to connect to the school provided server.
:one: **Create an SSH key pair**
      - Bash script that creates an RSA key pair.
:two: **Client configuration file**
      - SSH configuration file configured to use the private key `~/.ssh/holberton and to refuse authenication using a password.
